title: Our new Agentic RL work, CLEANER, is now open-source!
date: '2026-01-22'
summary: Our paper "CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning" is now available. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141); [Code](https://github.com/Tianshi-Xu/Open-CLEANER). CLEANER resolves the credit assignment dilemma in agentic RL by training on self-purified trajectories, achieving SOTA performance with just one-third of the training cost.
